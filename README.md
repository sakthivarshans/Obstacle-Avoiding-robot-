 Obstacle Avoidance Robot Using Raspberry Pi ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

This repository contains the implementation of an **Obstacle Avoidance Robot** built with **Raspberry Pi**. The robot uses ultrasonic sensors for detecting obstacles and dynamically adjusts its movement to avoid collisions, making it an essential project in robotics and automation.
Features
- Real-time obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors.
- Motor control for forward, backward, left, and right movements via GPIO.
- Simple yet efficient algorithm for navigation and obstacle avoidance.
How It Works
1. Measures distance to obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.
2. Controls the robot's motors based on obstacle proximity.
3. Performs real-time adjustments to avoid collisions and ensure smooth navigation.
